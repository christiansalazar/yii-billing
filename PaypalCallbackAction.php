					'url' => Yii::app()->params['paypal_url'],
				),
				'backtomerchant'=>array(
					'class'=>
						'application.extensions.yii-billing.BacktoMerchantAction',
				),
			);
		}

	$txn_type = $_POST['txn_type'];
	$payer_id = $_POST['payer_id'];
	$txn_id = $_POST['txn_id'];
	$payment_date = $_POST['payment_date'];
